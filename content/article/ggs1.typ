== How Could Disease Be So Deadly?
According to the book, about 95% of Native Americans died due disease. This is kind of an insane number, so here is my attempt to rationalize it.

*Claim:* The disease's high death rate would've prevented it from spreading.
+ *Counterpoint:*: For a disease to spread, it needs to spread faster then it dies. If it can spread before it kills the host, then it can continue to proliferate. Hence it could be deadly and continue to spread. 

*Claim:* There is an evolutionary incentive to not kill the host, since then the host can continue to spread the virus for longer (and potentially get infected later). Hence, the diseases should not have been so deadly.
+ *Counterpoint:* Sure, and the diseases probably had evolved to be less deadly... for Europeans. It seems likely they weren't at an evolutionary equilibrium for the Native Americans.
+ *Counterpoint:* Also, an individual disease might not be very deadly, but a combination of pathogens at the same time might be far more deadly then any individual disease.
+ *Counterpoint:* Furthermore, there's a compounding effect. When an individual person gets sick, there are probably people they can rely on to take care of them while they recover. When an entire society gets sick at the same time, resources are extremely strained, and people can die due to factors beside the disease, such as famine.

*Claim:* The infected societies would've learned how deadly the diseases were, and taken precautions to prevent their spread before they were annihalted.
+ *Counterpoint:* Europeans acted as carriers for the disease and continued to infect new populations despite such precautions.
+ *Counterpoint:* Information travelled exceptionally slowly at the time. The societies in the Americas were relatively isolated and remained unaware of other major events, like the eradication of a neighboring society. Hence, it was hard to become aware of the disease before you were suddenly struck by it. Once your society was struck, the variety of pathogens and high rate of spread made it almost impossible to stop.

== Could It Happen Again?
Could we find some dense society, hidden off in the Amazon, with superbugs capable of razing our population? Probably not. A major society like that would probably have been noticed by sattelite imagery or the massive amount of people traveling the world. The society would be relatively isolated, so the people who did find such bugs would probably have a relatively hard time surviving long enough to transmit them to others. And we have far more political coordination, things like an entire village getting sick and everyone dying wouldn't happen, because our political units are way larger.
