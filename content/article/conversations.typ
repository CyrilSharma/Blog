Hi! I was thinking more about #link("https://awestover.github.io/thoughts/talking-to-people")[this] person's conception of conversations today. They define a *strong* conversation as one primarily focused on personal growth, of takeaways which you will apply to your own life. *Fun* conversations are about getting to know people, hearing their stories and perspectives.

Some personal observations about strong conversations
+ Often require working through insecurities, which can be taxing.
+ Have narrower range then *fun* conversations, since they are tied to pragmatism.
+ Often not what people are interested in discussing. Many people regard the future with uncertainity (myself included) and kind of prefer to steer way from what their exact plan is. I'd say with friends, the vast majority of my conversations are *fun* rather then *strong*.
+ Can require strong convictions, as you are often in a situation where you need to give or receive advice.

For these reasons, I find *strong* conversations to be relatively taxing. That's not to say I don't want them, it's kind of like eating your vegetables, a little unpleasant but good for you.

Of course, some of these problems are self-induced. If I had strong convictions and few major insecurities, I would probably like *strong* conversations more.

However, even then I think I would enjoy *fun* conversations more, if only for the range reason. My opinion at the moment is *strong* conversations only let you consider reality, the pragmatics of a situation. *Fun* conversations let you consider everything else.
