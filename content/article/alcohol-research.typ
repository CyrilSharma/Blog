I don't think people should drink alcohol. These are my main reasons.
=== Alcohol enables some really stupid decisions.
About 66 percent of college students #footnote[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25820611/] report doing something they ended up regretting under the influence of alcohol. Just a few consequences include potentially harming others (violent behavior, drunk driving), or doing things that could cost you your most important relationships.

You might say you wouldn't do such things if you were drunk. But how can you be confident you will _never_ do them? I doubt any of the people who ended up making poor decisions expected it to happen.

=== Alcohol is really bad for your health.
+ The surgeon general has reccomended all alcoholic beverages should be required to mention the heightened risk of cancer on the bottles, analogous to cigars. Actually enforcing this will require congressional action. It's worth noting they already carry warnings regarding impacts to general health.
+ Light to moderate consumption of alcohol is sufficient for about half of all alcohol-attributable cancers in the EU. _Light to moderate consumption_ is responsible for the _majority_ of alcohol-related breast cancer cases in the EU #footnote[https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health].
+ In 2016, Alcohol was the leading risk factor for death and disability for people aged 15 to 49 #footnote[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/global-burden?utm_source=chatgpt.com].
+ Alcohol is the third leading cause of cancer after tobacco and obesity #footnote[https://time.com/7204606/surgeon-general-cancer-warning-alcohol/?utm_source=chatgpt.com].
+ Alcohol can cause permanently degraded cognitive abilities, especially if you get drunk a lot as a young adult #footnote[https://www.psu.edu/news/eberly-college-science/story/early-adult-binge-drinking-has-lasting-impact-aging-brain-mice?utm_source=chatgpt.com].

As an after thought, alcohol consumption might be in the same place cigar consumption was in the 20th century: socially acceptable, terrible for you, and with a growing body of evidence implicating it with disease.

To be honest, there's not a ton of evidence that drinking _really_ sporadically is bad for you, like if you never drink more then one drink at a time and at most once a month, there's nothing that really shows health detriments. But, I could probably say the same thing about cigarettes. The risk is of course, that you won't be able to thread this precise line of healthy consumption. Doing something 1 percent of the time is harder then doing it 0 percent of the time. 

=== If you become addicted, it can obliterate your life.
The odds of becoming addicted are small, but not negligible, #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism?utm_source=chatgpt.com")[wikipedia] states roughly 12 percent of American adults have a dependency at some point in their life, and there are roughly 360 million people with alcoholism world-wide. I also think people, especially intellectual people, have the belief their intelligence would shield them from every ending up in this situation. I think this is true to an extent, but I think a lot of people my age haven't gone through truly challenging life circumstances. It's not at all clear to me that you can forecast how you'll cope under stress. What if you don't have a good support system? What if the lack of support system is the thing you are trying to cope with? 


=== Sidenote: Try before you deny
I think drinking alcohol probably feels great! That's all the more reason to _never try it_. If you know something is bad for you, trying it and realizing you like it is not in your best interest. I think people are happy to accept this idea with other, less socially acceptable substances, like cocaine and "hard" drugs. While Alcohol may not be as bad as some substances, it is, as mentioned above, _still very bad for you_. The *WHO* classifies it as a Class 1 Carinogen, and has stated there is no safe level of alcohol consumption #footnote[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/global-burden?utm_source=chatgpt.com].

=== Sidenote: You'll miss out on the social lubricant
Sure, I will. But I can and do still have wonderful social interactions while being fully in control of my actions (socially unlubricated). If you really feel like you want more out of your interactions, there are plenty of other solutions. Try to be a better listener, ask interesting questions, and take social initiative! Nobody is stopping you from hanging out and you can still have amazing drinks (alcohol is not really known for _elevating_ the taste). I really think you can get most of the value without sacrificing your health.
