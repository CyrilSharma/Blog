There are a few types of people I've met.
+ People who _fear_ work.
  - They might think work is fundamentally uninteresting.
  - Alternatively, they might think they're unable to get an interesting job.
+ People who _minimize_ work. 
  - They treat work as an unfortunate necessity of life.
  - They want an easy job so they can focus on the rest of their life, family, friends, etc.
+ People who want work to bring _luxury_.
  - They want to make a ton of money, then splurge on restaurants, go on fancy vacations, etc.
+ People who want work to be _engaging_. 
  - They want to wake up and solve interesting problems all day.
  - Whether the problems are important is not a big factor.
+ People who want work to bring _growth_.
  - They want to grow as an engineer, a leader, etc.
+ People who want work to bring _glory_.
  - They want to write the next big paper.
  - They want to become the CEO of the next major company.
+ People who want work to have _value_.
  - They want their work to contribute to human welfare as a whole.

A lot of people are a mix. I think (1), (2), (3, 4, 5), and (4, 5, 6) are the most common types of people I've met.

Recently I've found out a lot of highly intelligent people are not even interested in category 7. Apparently, at top schools aspects 3 and 4 are dominant motivations for a lot of people (e.g. everybody wants to do Quant). Perhaps its because getting into such schools requires optimizing really aggressively for the metrics schools care about (performance in competition X), so everyone there is biased towards maximizing category 4. Still, I was under the impression that this was a minority of students, not an overwhelming majority.

I don't get how category 7 doesn't interest people. Surely if you were presented the choice between two potential workplaces this should be a big factor. If it really means nothing, I guess how do you define your purpose in life? Like, is the purpose of life to just maximize your personal happiness?

Maybe there's nothing wrong with that. I just think it's a waste of talent and time. And I personally don't see how people could find it fulfilling.
