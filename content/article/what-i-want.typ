Initially, CS interested me because you could have enormous social impact, provided you could solve some very hard problems (e.x. Alphafold). I think there’s been somewhat of a value drift from “I want to solve hard problems to do good things” to “I want to solve hard problems”.

The more I think about, the less interesting doing something without social impact seems to me. I feel like it’s quite possible I could spend my career solving challenging problems, and then look back on it all and think it’s entirely worthless. So, I'm going to put more effort into finding companies and roles which have good social impact. 

Social impact is a bit of a vague term. For me, it’s about doing something which would improve the lives of the many in an important way.

- Increasing the speeds with which we can develop medicines.
- Improving our treatments for aging in general.
- Solving Self-driving, which makes goods a lot cheaper, and is a pretty big QOL and environment improvement.
- Humanoid Robotics? Vastly improving factory automation and scaling down the number of dangerous jobs people seems pretty impactful.

To contrast this, there are also unimportant ways to improve peoples lives

- You could make monitors refresh slightly faster.
- You could make financial markets respond microseconds faster.
- You could improve developer tools… for developers who aren’t doing much social good.
- You could make S3 go from 10 9s of durability to 11.

... and ways to worsen peoples lives

- Developing AGI at a company with no regard for making it safe, and rolling it out with no regard for people’s livelihoods.
- Solving very important and technically interesting problems in the field of warfare.

To be clear, this doesn't mean I am not interested in solving challenging problems. In fact, I think it would be a waste of my skills not to do so. It's just that I think there are a lot of interesting problems which add little to the world if solved.
