+ Does our current set of physical laws predict consciousness, or are we missing laws?
+ What is the smallest collection of atoms that can be conscious?
+ Suppose you have someone whose two brain halves are _completely_ separate. Is each half conscious? #footnote[Note that despite all the intriguing experimental results, split-brain patients only exhibit a single will, so presumably they have only a single consciousness.] What degree of connectivity do you need between the two halves to get one consciousness instead of two? Why isn't any contiguous subset of neurons conscious?
+ What conditions are required for continuity of consciousness? Will your consciousness continue if you suffer amnesia? A concussion? Wake up from a coma? What about if you atomize and then reconstruct your brain?
+ Can consciousness and/or continuity of consciousness be examined experimentally?
