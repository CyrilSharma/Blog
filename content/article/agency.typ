I think a reasonable way to think of life is to imagine you are stuck in a river.

*environment*: The river. It does not completely determine where you are going but it has undeniable influence. If the river is flowing very fast, there may be little you can do.

*agency*: The desire, will, and initiative to steer yourself. This doesn't mean you can do anything, your swimming abilities are not infinite. Nonetheless, a high-agency person seeks to shape their trajectory as much as possible.

*self-confidence*: How much you think you can change your trajectory. 

*self-worth*: An assessment of what trajectory you think you deserve. Do you deserve to get out of the river? 

Although somewhat independent, it is hard to be agentic without self-confidence and self-worth. Without self-worth, you don't have the motivation to change your life, without self-confidence, you'll think you don't have the capacity.
