*What is the purpose of this blog?*
+ To refine my thoughts! The blog's publicity creates a strong incentive to ensure some degree of coherency. Furthermore, writing inherently increases your ability to juggle and refine ideas. It's like how a mathematician can deal with problems too large to fit in his mind by using a piece of paper. I think I can grow a lot from having more coherent writeups and opinons.
+ A new home for notes! Typst is a great language for math. It's also great for generating diagrams which makes me think I should be able to make good explainers on this website. E.g. Diffusion Model Math from scratch, etc.
+ Fun with webdev! Developing the website itself is pretty fun. By continuing to mod the html export, I could add components like Toggles or searchable Databases directly within Typst (despite it being a static content generator!) which is cool. Developing a metadata editor also seems fun.
