How much would the expected human lifespan go up if you completely cured Cancer? According to #link("https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2690099/#:~:text=Figure%201%2C%20based%20on%20calculations,been%20routinely%20feasible%20in%20rodents.")[this study], and echoed by many other studies, only about 2-3 years. In fact, this same study estimates that even the elimination of cancer, heart diseases, stroke, and diabetes combined would only add about 14 years. This is because when you get really old, your odds of getting any disease goes up exponentially. Hence, eliminating a few major diseases doesn't help much, because your body will soon get something that we don't have a treatment for. Furthermore, the exponentially increasing risk of disease puts a lot of strain on your body, so even if we have a treatment for the disease it becomes a lot harder to weather.

I mention this because I had a spurt of optimism the other day. I saw a study that could accurately diagnose you with a variety of diseases just from #link("https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04133-4.pdf")[analyzing your sleep]. I saw the potential for #link("https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DfrSZaf3JC8vJdbZL/how-to-make-superbabies")[gene-editing babies] to minimize the next generation's risk of Cancer. I had hoped that if we just became really good at preventative medicine, keeping the egg that is our body from getting scrambled, we could make a sizeable step towards conquering death.

This isn't anything to scoff at, but it's not nearly enough. To defeat death, we'll need to learn how to unscramble eggs. We need to solve aging itself.
