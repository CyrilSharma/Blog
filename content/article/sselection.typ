The canonical answer in biology class is "genetic diversity", but this isn't such an obvious win. Here are some of the disadvantages. 

+ Imagine I have a sexual population equal parts male and female. Suppose every mother gives birth to two children, then the population size doesn't change. However, if this was an asexual population, every individual would've been able to reproduce, and the population size could've doubled. 
+ Suppose I have evolved some really good set of genes. In an asexual population, my set of genes would get propogated, virtually unchanged, to the next generation. In a sexual population, have the genes would get thrown out and replaced with my mate's dna. This doesn't seem to be an obviously good thing.
+ Genetic diversity isn't always advantageous. Let's say I'm playing a card game and drew a really good hand. If I had the choice between keeping my hand and mixing it with someone elses, I would probably keep my hand, because I know in the next round the hand will still be good. 

So then why is sexual reproduction so common? Well, in most environments, thinks like pathogens and parasites mean the environment actually _is always changing_, not on a timescale of epochs but literally month to month. Hence, in rapidly-changing environments, you will see sexual selection predominates, whereas in static environments, asexual reproduction dominates.
