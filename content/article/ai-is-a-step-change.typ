The following claim (1) comes up a lot.
#quote(block: true)[
  _AI is a major technology that will change the world. Like previous revolutionary technology (e.x. computers, factory robots, etc.), many jobs will be eliminated. However, in their place, many more jobs will arise, to capitalize on all the new opportunities.  _
]

I don't buy it. To see why, let's look at the differences between computers and AI.

There were many people who thought computers would eliminate a lot of jobs. The reasoning was that a much smaller team could do the work of a much larger team, and hence reduce operating costs. However, instead of hiring less people, companies started hiring _more_ people, why? Well from the companies perspective, the marginal value of adding a single person went _up_, armed with a computer, a single person could add much more value then they could before.

What about with AI? Well, now, for a lot of jobs, companies will have to choose between spending more money on AI agents which perform tasks, or humans which perform the same set of tasks. If AI is much better and cheaper, then why would you ever hire a human?

The key difference is that computers are a _collaborative_ technology, they allow a person to do much more then they could without one. On the other hand, AI is a _competitive_ technology, it's trying to offer the same skill-set as a person.

As an analogy, imagine your company gives people haircuts. Previously, better haircut technology didn't affect the number of employees you had, it just increased the quality of the service. The technology was _collaborative_. Now, imagine there's a robot which can deal out high-quality haircuts for a fraction of the cost of a person, a _competitive_ technology. Assuming you keep your customers, your company will make more money buying robots then it would paying for employees.

I think the reason people claim (1) is they don't realize AI is the first _competitive_ technology for intellectual labor. As AI will only get better over time, I personally expect AI to eventually eliminate the demand for intellectual labor.

It's worth noting that we are still far away from this point. Even if AGI works beautifully tomorrow, it would have very limited interaction with the real world. There's only so much you can predict about the real-world without being able to make observations and do experiments. For example, nobody could've ever intuited quantum mechanics by just thinking in isolation. Furthermore, imagine asking as AI to debug hardware. If you set up the cabling wrong, or things are too hot, hardware might fail for reasons unrelated to the software. It would be very hard for an AI to debug this, because it can't make the observations a human who was physically there could (although it could give suggestions for what to look for). For this reason, in the short-term I would expect AGI to shift the niches for intellectual labor, not destroy them. 

This "shifting" of intellectual labor could have interesting effects. For one thing the demand for software engineers to design software for other developers might fizzle out (AI could do this for much cheaper). Those engineers could all move to "traditional" engineering disciplines, where it's much harder for AI to be as useful. So there will be a movement of software engineers to other industries.

Furthermore, you might expect there to be a movement of engineers to other _locations_. Imagine country A has lots of people with high skill in doing forms of intellectual labor, but there's little demand for their talents because A has AGI (and highly advanced robotics). Then intellectual labor might shift to countries that don't have these technologies yet. It's like how software engineers come to the U.S because the demand is all here. When AGI comes, the demand might evaporate in the U.S and the engineers will instead immigrate to other countries.
