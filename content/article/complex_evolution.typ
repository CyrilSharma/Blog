I like to understand how the world works. I realized the other day that I don't _really_ get how evolution works. In particular, there are a few major holes.


*If every step of evolution must confer a selection advantage, then how did complex structures which seem to only be useful when fully formed evolve?*

*Can acquired characteristics (e.g. my swimming ability) be inherrited?*

From what I could find, there is almost no mechanisms by which #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism")[Lamarckian] evolution occurs. Lamarckian evolution is the idea that organsism can adept to their environment, and that these adaptations are inherited.

*How can random genotypic change allow evolution to occur at a reasonable rate?*

If Lamarckian evolution was prevalent, then it would answer the question as follows: when a new environmental change happens, animals simply learn how to cope with it, and these coping mechanisms are inherrited and enhanced by their descendents. This allows rapid adaptive change.


*How do we can quantitaviely attain confidence then some feature could've evolved in some time frame?*
